1. sudo groupadd project1
2. sudo gpasswd -a john
3. sudo gpasswd -a user01 project1
4. sudo cd home; mkdir project1
5. sudo chmod 770 project1
6. sudo chown john project1
7. umask 0027
8. The umask changes the permissions by removing the write permission from the group permission and removing all permissions from the others.
9. I can't copy the file because the group permissions doesn't allow user01 to write to the directory.
10. You don't have permission on this server.
11. sudo chown user01 project1
12. user01 ownership permission allow full access to the directory.
13. sudo chmod 770 project
